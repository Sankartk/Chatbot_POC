Real-time Chat and Employee Directory Application
This project encompasses a real-time chat application integrated with an employee directory, both of which are powered by Firebase Realtime Database. The backend functionality is handled by FastAPI, a modern, fast web framework for building APIs with Python. The frontend interface is built using AngularJS, providing a dynamic and responsive user experience.

Features
Real-time messaging: Users can send and receive messages instantly.
Chat log retrieval: The application supports fetching and displaying a history of chat messages.
Dynamic employee directory: Users can query and display employees by department, with data hosted on Firebase.
Responsive design: The application is designed to work on both desktop and mobile browsers.
Technologies
Frontend: AngularJS is used for a single-page application experience, allowing for dynamic updates and real-time interactions without the need for page refreshes.
Backend: FastAPI is utilized for its high performance and ease of use in creating robust APIs. It also provides automatic Swagger documentation.
Database: Firebase Realtime Database offers a NoSQL database solution that synchronizes data in real-time to every connected client.
Styling: Custom CSS is applied for styling, enhancing the visual appeal and usability of the application.
Background
The project aims to provide an efficient and interactive way for users to communicate and access employee information within an organization. By integrating with Firebase, the application ensures that the data is always up to date and reflects real-time changes. Whether it's simple queries for employee details or exchanging messages in a chat, the application caters to both functionality in a unified interface.

Designed with scalability in mind, this application can be extended to include additional features such as user authentication, extended chat functionalities (like groups and media sharing), and more detailed employee profiles.

Potential Use Cases
Internal communication tool within organizations.
Customer support chat system.
Live Q&A sessions during webinars or online events.
Interactive employee directory for large organizations.
This project is a testament to the capabilities of combining modern frontend frameworks with powerful backend technologies to create real-time, data-driven web applications.
